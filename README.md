# Psychic-Game

Conclusion:

This assignemnet definitely challeneged me to the fullest. Before this course, I would watch programming videos online and could not make any sense of javascript. It was probably the biggest scare from me in programming. Through trial and error and playing around with the code in this game, I have developed a much better understanding of javascript. I spent around 20hrs on this code. I also want to give a shout out to my classmate, Megan, for inspiring me to push the CSS of this assignment to the next level and play with opacity.
